# Coding Workflow Preferences
- Focus only on the areas of code relevant to the task at hand
- Do not touch code that is unrelated to the task
- Write thorough tests for all major functionality
- Always analyze edge cases and handle errors gracefully
- Avoid making major changes to existing patterns and architecture unless explicitly instructed
- Consider what other methods and areas of code might be affected by your changes
- Follow Flutter best practices for performance optimization
- Document complex logic or non-obvious code decisions
- Use const constructors whenever possible
