# Flutter Best Practices

## Performance Optimization
- Use `const` constructors whenever possible
- Optimize builds by only rebuilding what changes
- Keep widget tree as flat as possible
- Extract widgets that don't need to rebuild
- Use lazy loading for expensive resources
- Avoid heavy computations on the UI thread; use isolates when needed
- Use keys appropriately for widget identification

## Responsive Design
- Design for multiple screen sizes and orientations
- Use responsive layout widgets (Expanded, Flexible, LayoutBuilder)
- Test on various device sizes
- Consider text scaling for accessibility

## State Management
- Use BLoC/Cubit pattern for complex state management
- Follow unidirectional data flow
- Keep states immutable
- Avoid unnecessary rebuilds

## Navigation
- Use named routes for navigation
- Handle deep linking properly
- Implement proper error handling and loading states
- Consider route transitions for better UX

## Localization
- Support RTL layouts where necessary
- Use the app's localization system for all user-facing text
- Follow the localization workflow established in the project

## Accessibility
- Ensure sufficient contrast ratios
- Provide semantic labels for screen readers
- Use appropriate text sizes
- Implement proper focus traversal

## Testing
- Write unit tests for business logic
- Write widget tests for UI components
- Use mocks and fakes for dependencies
- Aim for high test coverage on business logic

## Error Handling
- Use try-catch blocks appropriately
- Provide meaningful error messages
- Implement graceful degradation when services fail
- Log errors in a structured way for better debugging
