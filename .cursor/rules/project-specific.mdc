# AGROSYS Specific Guidelines

## Project Overview
AGROSYS is a Flutter mobile application for agricultural system management, focusing on device management and scheduling. The application follows a clean architecture approach with the following key features:

- Device management and monitoring
- Schedule creation and management
- Notification system
- Background services for continuous monitoring
- SMS sending capabilities for remote control
- Dark/light theme support
- RTL language support (Arabic)

## Key Components
- AppStateCubit: Manages overall application state
- DeviceCubit: Manages device-related state
- ScheduleService: Handles scheduling and device monitoring
- NotificationService: Manages app notifications
- BackgroundServiceManager: Manages background tasks
- SMSController: Handles SMS operations

## Core Functionality
- The app primarily uses SharedPreferences for data persistence
- Background tasks run using flutter_foreground_task
- Notifications are used to alert users about device schedules
- App supports both light and dark themes with customized theming
- App is designed with RTL (Arabic) support as the default direction

## Important Considerations
- Always maintain Arabic language support in all UI components
- Ensure SMS functionality works properly across different device types
- Background services must work reliably without being killed by the OS
- Schedule monitoring should be accurate with proper alarm handling
- Handle device state updates efficiently
- Follow Material Design guidelines with the custom app theme
